## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to better utilize rem units. I also created my first table with html and css. I had some issues with the table I have yet to resolve but looking forward to finding an answer.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to learning more bout flexbox and grid. Responsive design is very important and utilizing these components into achieving that. I am looking forward to jumping into JavaScript in these upcoming projects.
